# Interface: CheckBundle

Describes a bundle used by model-check.

If `path` is defined, model-check will load that local JS bundle file.

If `path` is undefined, but `url` is defined, model-check will load the
remote bundle file at that URL.

If both `path` and `url` are undefined, model-check will load the latest
`check-bundle.js` generated by the build process.
