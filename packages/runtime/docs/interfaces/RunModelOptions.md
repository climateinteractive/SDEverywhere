# Interface: RunModelOptions

Additional options that can be passed to a `runModel` call to influence the model run.

## Properties

### lookups

 `Optional` **lookups**: [`LookupDef`](LookupDef.md)[]

If defined, override the data for the specified lookups and/or data variables.

If data was already defined in the generated model, the data provided in a
`LookupDef` here will override the default data in the generated model.

Note that unlike the `inputs` parameter for `runModel` (which must be provided
with each call), the data overrides provided here persist after the `runModel`
call.  If you pass `lookups` in your Nth `runModel` call, that lookup data will
still be in effect for the (N+1)th call.  In other words, if your lookup data
is not changing, you do not need to supply it with every `runModel` call.
