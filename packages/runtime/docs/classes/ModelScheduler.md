# Class: ModelScheduler

A high-level interface that schedules running of the underlying `WasmModel`.

When one or more input values are changed, this class will schedule a model
run to be completed as soon as possible.  When the model run has completed,
`onOutputsChanged` is called to notify that new output data is available.

The `ModelRunner` is pluggable to allow for running the model synchronously
(on the main JavaScript thread) or asynchronously (in a Web Worker or Node.js
worker thread).

## Constructors

### constructor

**new ModelScheduler**(`runner`, `userInputs`, `outputs`)

#### Parameters

| `outputs` | [`Outputs`](Outputs.md) | The structure into which the model outputs will be stored. |

## Properties
