 * instance with different sets of inputs and outputs.  For example, you can
 * use this to show the outputs for multiple scenarios in a single graph, or
 * multiple scenarios across different graphs.
 *
 * When input values are changed in one or more contexts, this class will schedule
 * a model run for each changed context to be completed as soon as possible.
 * When the model run has completed, the context's `onOutputsChanged` function
 * is called to notify that new output data is available for that context.
 *
 * The `ModelRunner` is pluggable to allow for running the model synchronously
 * (on the main JavaScript thread) or asynchronously (in a Web Worker or Node.js
 * worker thread).
