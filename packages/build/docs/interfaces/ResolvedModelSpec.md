# Interface: ResolvedModelSpec

Describes a model (e.g., a Vensim mdl file) and the input/output variables
that should be included in the model generated by SDEverywhere.  This is
largely the same as the `ModelSpec` interface, except this one has been
fully resolved (paths have been validated, input and output variables have
been checked, etc).  This is the spec object that will be passed to plugin
functions.

## Properties

### inputVarNames

 **inputVarNames**: `string`[]

The input variable names for the model.  This will be defined regardless
of whether `ModelSpec.inputs` was defined as an array of variable names
or an array of `InputSpec` instances.  (The input variable names are
derived from the `InputSpec` instances as needed.)

___

### inputs

 **inputs**: [`InputSpec`](InputSpec.md)[]

The input variable specs for the model.

___

### outputVarNames

 **outputVarNames**: `string`[]

The output variable names for the model.  This will be defined regardless
of whether `ModelSpec.outputs` was defined as an array of variable names
or an array of `OutputSpec` instances.  (The output variable names are
derived from the `OutputSpec` instances as needed.)

___

### outputs

 **outputs**: [`OutputSpec`](OutputSpec.md)[]

The output variable specs for the model.

___

### datFiles

 **datFiles**: `string`[]

The dat files that provide the data for exogenous data variables in the
model.

___

### options

 `Optional` **options**: `Object`

Additional options included with the SDE `spec.json` file.

#### Index signature

â–ª [key: `string`]: `any`
