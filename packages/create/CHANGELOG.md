### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* The `startTime` and `endTime` properties have been removed from the `ModelSpec` interface in the `@sdeverywhere/build` package, so it is no longer necessary for you to provide them in your `sde.config.js` file.

### Bug Fixes

* remove `startTime` and `endTime` from `ModelSpec` interface and handle SAVEPER != 1 ([921014a](https://github.com/climateinteractive/SDEverywhere/commit/921014aeeda646a130ac324823ab5633d6abcdfa))
