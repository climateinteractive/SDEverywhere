# @sdeverywhere/create

Create a new [SDEverywhere](https://github.com/climateinteractive/SDEverywhere) project with minimal configuration.

## Quick Start

```sh
# Create a fresh directory for your project (if desired)
mkdir my-sde-project

# Copy your mdl file to that directory.  (If you don't have a mdl file yet,
# that's OK, you can skip this step!  The "create" command will offer to
# add a sample mdl file so that you can continue evaluating SDEverywhere.)
cp my-model.mdl my-sde-project

# Change to your new directory and launch the "create" script...
cd my-sde-project

# ...with npm
npm create @sdeverywhere

# ...or, with pnpm
pnpm create @sdeverywhere

# ...or, with yarn
yarn create @sdeverywhere
```
