# @sdeverywhere/check-ui-shell

This package provides a complete user interface for a model check/comparison report as generated by [SDEverywhere](https://github.com/climateinteractive/SDEverywhere).

## Quick Start

The best way to get started with SDEverywhere is to follow the [Quick Start](https://github.com/climateinteractive/SDEverywhere#quick-start) instructions.
If you follow those instructions, the `@sdeverywhere/plugin-check` package will be added to your project, and that package uses `@sdeverywhere/check-ui-shell` as an implementation detail.
Therefore, most users do not need to install this package directly.

## Install

As noted above, most users do not need to install this package directly, but for more advanced use cases, it can be installed as follows.

```sh
# npm
npm install @sdeverywhere/check-ui-shell

# pnpm
pnpm add @sdeverywhere/check-ui-shell

# yarn
yarn add @sdeverywhere/check-ui-shell
```

## Usage

Most users do not need to interact with the `@sdeverywhere/check-ui-shell` package directly; it is primarily used in the implementation of the `@sdeverywhere/plugin-check` package.

However, if you would like to build a custom tool for running checks and comparison tests on models, you can refer to the API documentation below for more details.

## Documentation

API documentation is available in the [`docs`](./docs/index.md) directory.
