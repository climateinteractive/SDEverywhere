# Force pnpm to link local packages:
#   https://pnpm.io/npmrc#link-workspace-packages
# The default value of this option was true in pnpm <= 8, but was changed
# to false in pnpm 9; setting it to true here should work for both versions.
# Note that we don't use `workspace:` protocol for intra-repo dependencies
# because those don't always play well with release-please, so instead we
# use normal semver ranges (e.g., "^1.2.3") and let pnpm handle resolution.
