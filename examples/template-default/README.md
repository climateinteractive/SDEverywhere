# template-default

This is a template that is used by the `@sdeverywhere/create` package to generate a
new project that uses SDEverywhere.

## Quick Start

```sh
# Create a new project (you can also use yarn or pnpm here, if preferred).
# Be sure to choose the "Default" template.
npm create @sdeverywhere

# Enter development mode for your model.  This will start a live
# development environment that will build a WebAssembly version of the
# model and run checks on it any time you make changes to:
#   - the config files
#   - the Vensim model file (<name>.mdl)
#   - the checks file (<name>.check.yaml)
npm run dev
```
